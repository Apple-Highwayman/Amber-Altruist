AMBER alerts are a great idea; they inform the public and involve everyone in the task of keeping children safe. However,
we rarely get any useful information from them. We get a liscence plate, but if we're in the car where we may be able to use 
that information, we shouldn't be invested in our phones. They come without pictures and they disappear before we can look
up the alert for images or more information. We often get alerts in our homes, not when we might see something concerning.

Amber Altruist aims to fix that. At your convenience, open the app to find information on recent amber alerts with images, 
ages, and times/places that they went missing.
All we ask of you is to input your state for relevant local information. We won't save anything about you, 
or try to sell you anything.

Amber Altruist was dreamed up at UGAHacks 9. During this process, our greatest challenge was turning our
process into an application. Although the back-end logic was sound, parsing for RSS feeds was a new process for us.
We tried different methods before ultimately settling on Tkinter for a python GUI.

In the future, we intend to simplify our program into android and IOS apps, provide hugely increased ease of use 
and functionality, create web functionality, integrate with local PD, and create our own source of data to become 
less reliant on amber alerts, which feel particularly rare.
